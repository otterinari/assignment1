      A Rich Internet Application (RIA) is a Web application that is designed to deliver some key features
and functions normally associated with desktop applications, which will help the user in accessing
them. RIAs generally split the processing across the Internet/network divide by locating the user
interface and related activity and capability on the client side. However, RIAs usually run inside a Web
browser and normally do not require software installation on the client side to work. An RIA allows the
client system to handle local activities, reformatting, calculations etc.</td>
